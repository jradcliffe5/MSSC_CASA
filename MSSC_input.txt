# Inputs for the multi phase centre calibration
## The UV data for calibration needs to be in the same directory as this file and multi_source_self_cal.py
### Usage ParselTongue multi_source_self_cal.py MSSC_input.txt

### Running options
do_load     = True      # Load the data and create single 1Jy data for self-cal
do_self_cal = False       # Do the self cal iterations
use_DBAPP   = False      # Use DBAPP to concat (quicker but often doesn't work)

### File locations & loading options
apply_pbcor = False  ## To be used in conjunction with run_pbcor (EVN only)
pbcor_path = ''     ## path to tasav files for PBCOR (EVN only)
do_calib = True     ## Apply calibration & split data
UV_path = './UV/ms/'
UV_files =
UV_suffix = .fits

### AIPS Specific
AIPS_userno = 1004		# An AIPS user number with an empty catalogue!
AIPS_indisk = 1		# AIPS disk to use
AIPS_msgkill = 0		# How chatty dya want AIPS to be, -5 is quiet 5 is loud

### MSSC Setup
pointing_centre = -170.791333333, 62.216111111   #Pointing centre in deg
noteles = 12                    #Number of telescopes
reference_antenna = 3           #reference antenna used in phase referencing

### UV stacking
imsize = 1024                   #Image size in pixels.
niter = 25                    #Clean iterations

## Self calibration
solution_interval = 2           #self cal solution interval(s)

combineIFLLRR = 4               #data combination options (see below)
# Options: 1 no combination,  2 to combine IFs
#          3 to combine pols, 4 to combine all

amplitude_or_phase = 'P'        # 'P' phase only calibration, A&P amp and phase
self_cal_iter = 5               #Number of self_cal iterations

##########
# Need to run this with doload =1 first and doscal = 1.
# If the SN tables are not good and parameters need to be changed change doload = False
# so the set need not be loaded again! (this takes ages)
