# Inputs for the multi phase centre calibration
## The UV data for calibration needs to be in the same directory as this file and multi_source_self_cal.py
### Usage ParselTongue multi_source_self_cal.py MSSC_input.txt

### Running options
do_load     = True      # Load the data and create single 1Jy data for self-cal
do_self_cal = False       # Do the self cal iterations
use_DBAPP   = False      # Use DBAPP to concat (quicker but often doesn't work)

### File locations
UV_path = './UV/'
UV_files =
UV_suffix = .fits

### AIPS Specific
AIPS_userno = 1004		# An AIPS user number with an empty catalogue!
AIPS_indisk = 1		# AIPS disk to use
AIPS_msgkill = 0		# How chatty dya want AIPS to be, -5 is quiet 5 is loud

#Need to run this with doload =1 first and doscal = 1. If the SN tables are not good and parameters need to be changed change doload = 0
# so the set need not be loaded again! (this takes ages)
